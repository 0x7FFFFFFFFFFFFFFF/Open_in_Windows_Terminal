# Add "Open Windows Terminal" to your context menu

## Introduction
This repository contains some scripts to create a context menu item **Open Windows Terminal**. You can right click on any file, folder and the empty area of a folder to get this menu. See below demo.gif for the effects of the script.

## How to use
* Install Windows Terminal
* Run a PowerShell session as administrator and execute the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force` 
* Download [install.ps1](https://github.com/yangshuairocks/Open_in_Windows_Terminal/blob/master/Open%20in%20Windows%20Terminal/install.ps1)
* Right click `install.ps1`, choose `Run with PowerShell`. This will generate `wt.reg` and `wt_nonadmin.reg`.
* Double click `wt.reg`, click *Yes* and *OK*. This will add an entry *Open Windows Terminal* to your context menu.
* Optionally, double click `wt_nonadmin.reg`, click *Yes* and *OK*. This will add an entry *Open Windows Terminal(Non-Admin)* to your context menu.

Note that it is suggested to close UAC, otherwise you will see this every time you click context menu item *Open Windows Terminal*.

Now you can try to right click on something to see if it works.


## How does it work?
* The reg file adds entries to your registry so that you will have context menu item added.
* The `install.ps1` file adds some code to your PowerShell profile, which will be executed whenever you open a PowerShell command line.
* When you click the "Open Windows Terminal" context menu item, the full path of the current directly (if you are clicking on the blank area of a folder or if you are clicking on a folder) or the current file (if you are clicking on a file) will be stored in a temp file `$env:TEMP\windows_terminal_current_dir.temp` and a Windows Terminal session will be opened.
* The added code to PowerShell profile will check if the current PowerShell session is Windows Terminal, if it was run as administrator, if the file `$env:TEMP\windows_terminal_current_dir.temp` exists and whether the full path in `$env:TEMP\windows_terminal_current_dir.temp` refers to a file or a folder etc. and properly set the location to the one stored in `$env:TEMP\windows_terminal_current_dir.temp` and remove it.
* It's possible that a new Windows Terminal will open (ensure it's run as administrator) and the old one close. That's why you will probably see window flashes.  


## Problem
* As you see in the demo.gif, the PowerShell Window will flash one or two times (based on your configuration). I don't know how to solve this. This is not an issue to me, though. Please let me know if you have any ideas on this.
